#  Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius entered by the user.
# Sample Output :
# r = 1.1
# Area = 3.8013271108436504

# def area_of_circle(r,pi=3.14):
#     area=pi*(r*r)
#     print(f"Area of circle: {area}")
# r=float(input("Enter radius: "))
# area_of_circle(r)

# Write a Python program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.  

# def reverse(f_name,l_name):
#     print(f"{l_name} {f_name}")
# f_name=input("Enter your first name: ")
# l_name=input("Enter your last name: ")
# reverse(f_name,l_name)

# Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from the user and generates a list and a tuple of those numbers.
# Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23 

# def list_tuple(s):
#     l=s.split(",")
#     print(l)
#     t=tuple(l)
#     print(t)
# s=input("enter sequence: ")
# list_tuple(s)
